# Coursework
Coursework is a project that allows you to add the courses you have taken to a system and see them organized based on year and semester. This is way more convinient than looking at a degree audit that is hard to read and it doesn't give you the course description that you need when filling out an application. I would like to be able to have the power to export this and import a list of courses into the application. This is a project that will have multiple APIs implemented in different ways in order to help understand different design patterns and technolgies and their applications. Topics to be studied: Swagger, SQL Server, MongoDB, C# and .NET, LINQ, EF.

Different folders will have different APIs using SQL Server and then MongoDB and the EF. More to come on this. Will build and make meaningful commits with descriptions of updates made so it is easy to see how the application evolves
